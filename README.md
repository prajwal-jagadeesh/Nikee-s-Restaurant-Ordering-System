# Nikee's Zara - Restaurant Ordering System

This is a comprehensive, modern restaurant management application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a seamless, real-time ordering and management experience for customers, captains, kitchen staff, and POS operators, all running locally within the browser.

## Core Modules

The application is divided into four main user-facing modules:

1.  **Customer View (`/customer`)**: A dynamic, mobile-friendly menu where customers can browse items, place orders for their table, add more items, and request payment.
2.  **Captain View (`/captain`)**: A dashboard for service staff to monitor active orders, confirm new orders, and manage tables.
3.  **KDS (Kitchen Display System) (`/kds`)**: A real-time display for the kitchen staff, showing all active items that need to be prepared. Staff can update the status of each item as it moves through the cooking process.
4.  **POS (Point of Sale) (`/pos`)**: The central hub for managing the entire restaurant floor. It includes a table grid view, menu management, table management, settings, and sales analytics.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time State Sync**: Utilizes `zustand` and the browser's `localStorage` to create a real-time experience. Changes made in one module (e.g., a customer placing an order) are instantly reflected in all other open tabs or windows without needing a page refresh.
- **Dynamic Ordering**: Customers can place orders, and captains or POS operators can create or add to orders on behalf of customers.
- **KOT & Bill Management**:
    - Automated KOT (Kitchen Order Ticket) generation and printing workflow.
    - Duplicate KOT printing for any specific KOT.
    - Bill generation with support for duplicate bill printing.
- **Flexible Discount System**: Apply discounts to any order, either as a fixed amount (₹) or a percentage (%).
- **Payment Request Flow**: Customers can request payment via "Card" or "Cash/QR", which sends a real-time notification to the Captain and POS views.
- **Table Management**: POS operators can add, edit, and delete tables. QR codes for each table can be generated to link customers directly to their table's ordering page.
- **Menu Management**: A full-featured interface for POS operators to add, edit, and delete menu items and categories, and toggle their availability.
- **Sales Analytics**: A dashboard showing total revenue, total orders, and average order value, with filtering by date range.

## Process Flow & Logic

The application's logic is built around the lifecycle of an `Order`.

### 1. Order Creation
- **Customer**: Scans a QR code which opens `/customer?table=<number>`. They add items to their cart and place the order. The order status starts as `'New'`.
- **Captain/POS**: Can open a new order for a vacant table, add items, and confirm it.

### 2. Order Confirmation & KOT Printing
- A `'New'` order appears in the **Captain View** and **POS View**.
- A captain or POS operator must first "Confirm" the order.
- In the **POS View**, once an order is confirmed, the "Print KOT" button becomes active for any new items.
- Clicking "Print KOT" marks the `kotStatus` of those items as `'Printed'` and assigns them a unique KOT ID. The overall order status becomes `'Confirmed'`.

### 3. Kitchen & Item Progression
- Items with `kotStatus: 'Printed'` appear on the **KDS View**.
- The kitchen staff progresses each item through the stages:
    1.  **Pending**: Default state for a printed item.
    2.  **Preparing**: Kitchen starts working on the item.
    3.  **Ready**: Item is cooked and ready to be served.
- When an item is marked `'Ready'` on the KDS, it appears in the "Ready to Serve" section on the `OrderCard` in the Captain and POS views.
- A captain marks the item as `'Served'`.

### 4. Billing
- The "Generate Bill" button in the **POS View** is enabled ONLY when **all** items in an order are in the `'Served'` state.
- If a customer adds new items after others have been served, the "Generate Bill" button is disabled until the new items are also served.
- Applying a discount (percentage or amount) can be done from the order details sheet in the POS view at any time before payment.
- Generating a bill sets the order status to `'Billed'`.
- Duplicate bills can be printed for any order that has a status of `'Billed'`.

### 5. Payment
- Once an order is `'Billed'`, the "Proceed to Pay" button appears for the customer.
- The customer can choose a payment method:
    - **UPI**: Attempts to open a UPI app on the customer's device.
    - **Card** or **Cash/QR**: Sets a `paymentMethod` on the order object.
- This `paymentMethod` triggers a real-time notification on the corresponding `OrderCard` in the Captain and POS views (e.g., "Card Payment Requested").
- A captain acknowledges the request, clears the notification, and assists the customer.
- Once payment is received, the captain or POS operator marks the order as `'Paid'`, which removes it from the active displays.

## Deployment to Firebase

This project is configured for both manual and automated deployments to Firebase App Hosting, which works perfectly with the free Spark plan.

### Manual Deployment

You can deploy your app at any time from your local machine.

#### Prerequisites for Manual Deployment
- You must have a Firebase account.
- You must have the Firebase CLI installed on your machine. If not, install it globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```

#### Step 1: Login to Firebase
In your terminal, log in to your Firebase account:
```bash
firebase login
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Firebase
1.  In the root directory of your project, run the following command:
    ```bash
    firebase init
    ```
2.  You will be prompted with several questions. Follow these steps:
    -   "Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory?"
        -   Use the arrow keys to navigate to **App Hosting: Deploy Next.js web apps to a new backend**.
        -   Press `Space` to select it, then press `Enter`.
    -   "Please select an option:"
        -   Select `Use an existing project` and choose the project you created earlier.
    -   "What do you want to use as your public directory?"
        -   Press `Enter` to accept the default (`.next`). This is automatically detected.
    -   The CLI will then create a Firebase backend for App Hosting.

#### Step 3: Deploy Manually
After initialization, you can deploy your application at any time by running:
```bash
firebase deploy
```
The CLI will build your Next.js application and deploy it, providing you with the live URL.

### Automated Deployments with GitHub Actions

This repository is equipped with GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your application. A workflow will run on every merge to the `main` branch, deploying the latest version of your app to your live URL.

#### One-Time Setup for Automated Deployments

To enable this, you need to connect GitHub to Firebase and provide it with the necessary permissions.

1.  **Connect GitHub to Firebase**:
    *   In your terminal, run the following command from your project's root directory:
        ```bash
        firebase init hosting:github
        ```
    *   Follow the prompts:
        *   **Select the repository**: Choose your GitHub repository (`your-username/your-repo-name`).
        *   **Set up deployment script**: Say **yes** to setting up a build script. The command should be `npm ci && npm run build`.
        *   **Deploy on merge?**: Say **yes** when asked if you want to deploy on merging to the `main` branch.
        *   **Overwrite existing files?**: Say **no** if it asks to overwrite the workflow files, as they are already in the repository.

2.  **Create a Service Account**: The GitHub Action needs a service account to authenticate with your Firebase project.
    *   Go to the Google Cloud Console: [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/service-accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/service-accounts)
    *   Make sure you have selected your Firebase project from the project dropdown at the top of the page.
    *   Click **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
    *   Give it a name (e.g., `firebase-deploy-action`) and an ID.
    *   Click **CREATE AND CONTINUE**.
    *   In the "Grant this service account access to project" step, add the following roles:
        *   `Firebase App Hosting Admin`
        *   `API Keys Admin`
    *   Click **CONTINUE**, then **DONE**.

3.  **Generate a Key for the Service Account**:
    *   Find the service account you just created in the list.
    *   Click the three-dot menu (⋮) under "Actions" and select **Manage keys**.
    *   Click **ADD KEY** > **Create new key**.
    *   Choose **JSON** as the key type and click **CREATE**. A JSON file will download to your computer.

4.  **Add the Key as a GitHub Secret**:
    *   Go to your GitHub repository and navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
    *   Click the **New repository secret** button.
    *   For the **Name**, enter exactly: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NIKEES_ZARA`
    *   For the **Secret**, copy the *entire content* of the JSON key file you downloaded and paste it into the box.
    *   Click **Add secret**.

Now, every time you merge a pull request into your `main` branch, the GitHub Action will automatically run, build your project, and deploy it to Firebase App Hosting.
