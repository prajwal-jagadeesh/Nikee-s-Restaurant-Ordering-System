## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White (#FFFFFF) is used as background to maintain the clean, minimal feel of the reference application Petpooja, suggesting order, efficiency and modernity.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F5F5F5) adds depth and visual separation, without distracting the user.
- Accent color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) will draw attention to primary interactive elements, such as order placement, payment confirmation and other important buttons, while harmonizing with the neutral backdrop.
- Font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for headings and body text; maintains simplicity and ensures readability.
- Use flat, simple icons that clearly represent actions and categories, adopting a style similar to Petpooja.
- Maintain a grid-based layout with clear spacing and separation to make information easy to find and interact with, similar to the reference design.
- Implement subtle transitions for state changes and data loading to improve the user experience.
